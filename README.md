# 📚 Boogle — Open Source Search Engine for Free Books

**Boogle** is an open-source search engine designed to index and search books from multiple free and public-domain sources.  
The goal is to make it easy for readers, students, and researchers to find *free and legal* books across the web —  
without having to visit each site individually.

## Overview

Most public-domain book collections (like Project Gutenberg or Open Library) provide their own search features,
but none of them aggregate multiple sources or offer relevance ranking based on modern information retrieval techniques.

**Boogle** changes that.
It unifies data from different repositories, builds its own index,
and returns ranked results according to query relevance — just like a miniature, open-source version of Google Books.
